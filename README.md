IsShopping by faszkivan, a lightweight shopping list with a touch of flavor via emoji üçïüòä

Currently under development in our spare time for fun, so progress may be slow and updates intermittent.

I publish a web build along with every new APK over at [IsShopping-Web](https://fasz-kivan.github.io/IsShopping-Web/)

## Getting started

`flutter pub get`
yep, that's all afaik, but feel free to open an issue if it doesn't work

### To build the web version, use

`flutter build web --release --web-renderer canvaskit --base-href /IsShopping-Web/`
